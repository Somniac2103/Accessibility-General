role = "" change semantic meaning like changing a picture to button.

tabindex = "0" *order of tab sequence

Aria landmark = landmark roles, landmark region

Aria-hidden = hides element from screen readers

Aria terminonology:
  banner is the header
  complementaty is the sidebar
  contentinfo is the footer

SEMANTIC
-combine email in fieldset for screen reader.

-if you use display: none then the screen reader will also not pick it up. However making the opacity 0% will allow the reader to pick it up and not the visual.
-use position absolute huge number like 10000 for slidout menus so it is off screen for visual but still pick up for screen readers.
-add role attribute when using an element in a different way then intended.
-using the correct tag will automatically apply interactive properties. Like the tab to select it.
-screen reader banners is equal to header.
